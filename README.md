# Joint Savings Application

In this application, I will be automating the creation of a joint savings accounts. 
I create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account.
My smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution's requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposti and withdraw funds from the account.
